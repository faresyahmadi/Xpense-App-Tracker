Xpense Tracker is an intuitive iOS app designed to help users track their daily expenses, manage budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits. As a college student, I created this app to address the challenge of staying financially organized in a fast-paced world, offering a simple yet powerful tool for personal finance management.

I built the app using Swift and Firebase for data persistence. Xpense Tracker provides an intuitive interface to track my daily expenses with real-time updates.
When building the app, I focused on three main aspects:

***UI/UX Design:
Designing a visually appealing and intuitive interface was a top priority. I aimed to ensure that users could navigate the app effortlessly, add expenses quickly, and view their financial summaries at a glance. To refine the user experience, I conducted A/B testing, comparing different design layouts and workflows to identify what resonated most with users. This iterative approach helped optimize usability and aesthetic appeal.

***Data Security and Persistence:
Using Firebase, I ensured secure and reliable data storage for users' financial information. Real-time syncing capabilities were implemented to allow seamless data updates across devices, emphasizing both functionality and trustworthiness.

***Customization and Personalization:
I focused on providing users with features to personalize their experience, such as the ability to categorize expenses, set custom budget limits, and view tailored financial reports.

The primary aim of this project was to better understand my spending habits. I therefore had to learn Swift/Swift UI to be able to build my app.
